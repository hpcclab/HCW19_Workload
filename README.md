# HCW19_Workload
This repository includes Constant and variable rate workload trials used in HCW '19 workshop. Generated by Chavit Denninnart

constant.zip contains pre-generated task arrivals for constant arrival workload.
spiky.zip contains pre-generated task arrivals for spiky arrival workload.

class_2.etc is the etc matrix for simulating heterogeneous system.
homo_2.etc is the etc matrix for simulating homogeneous system.

To generate a new workload, edit generation numbers in homer_refurb_file_gen_spike.py or homer_refurb_file_gen.py
Then 
1.) call 
python homer_refurb_file_gen_spike.py  (or homer_refurb_file_gen.p )
to generate a lot of arrival tasks
2.) call 
python convertWorkLoad_spk.py (or python convertWorkLoad.py)
to generate deadline for each tasks and some format conversion
3.) call
python trimNumArrivals.py ./trials_prop1.0/trial_ 800
to trim arrival tasks down to 800 tasks for experiments
